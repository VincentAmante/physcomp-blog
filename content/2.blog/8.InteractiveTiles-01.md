title: Interactive Tiles Week 01

This week we began further exploring how we can implement having an interactable LED matrix with the use of buttons. 

The answer to this was a button matrix. How it would work was that all buttons are individually connected to one row and one column. When a button is pressed, it would connect a row and column, which allows the Arduino to pinpoint its location in the matrix. 

For example, if a button on row 2 and column 3 lights up, the Arduino would receive an input from Row 2 and column 3. As there's only one button that can light up those specific lines, the matrix knows the exact button being pressed and activates any related code respectively.

Here is a diagram showing the button matrix concept.
