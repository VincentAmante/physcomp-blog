After our success with the button matrix on the [previous week](./interactivetiles-01), we finished planning out the design and structure of the frame. Additionally we finished up the tiles and finally, added a lot of coding functionality to the LED Board.

## Design

We decided to name the board 'Deeno', likely uncreative but still a fun name as it stems from the word 'Arduino (Deeno)'. The board is planned to be encased like a box, and framed like a retro-ish game display.

## Tiles

After the prior week, we found that it was easier to stick vinyl stickers on the acrylic sheets, making it just the right amount of translucent for our purposes.

## Features & Functionality

We finalised the features we wanted for our Deeno board. They were a collection of fun features that students in campus could play around with, namely:
1. Audiovisualiser - A way to display any audio through fun colours
2. Paint - Enables basic art capabilities as users can press any tile to light it up with a specific colour.
3. Tic Tac Toe - Simple tic tac toe game, playable by two players.
4. Memory Game - Game that flashes pairs of tiles on the screen, each pair with differing colours. Players have to work with tapping tiles to find pairs based on the initial delay they were given.

Here, we also began tinkering with the code to have the interactable matrix grid. There was code in place for lighting up specific tiles, but we also wanted to be able to light up specific LEDs in rows and columns.

Lighting up a column was pretty easy, as the LEDs were adjacent to each other. Lighting up specific rows proved difficult, however, as the LED matrix was arranged in pairs of 'U'-like shapes. Working out how to light up a specific row required some arithmetic tinkering, which, given that none of us were dedicated math experts, took up a great hour to figure out.

Eventually though I managed to figure it out:
- by pairing up the led columns (of which there were 2 per tile column and arranged in a 'U'-shape), it was easy to light up a specific tile in the odd column (the first of the pair). 
- lighting up a tile on the even column (the second of the pair), required calculating the difference of the start of the second column from the end of the column, this allowed us to accurately locate an led despite being oriented a different way.
- Lighting up a specific led now just meant calculating how many pairs of led columns to skip, and then performing one of the above calculations.

With this, we could finally draw the constraints for the tic tac toe game, and then experiment with setting up its win conditions.
