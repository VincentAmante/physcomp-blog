On this week, we began performing Arduino experiments to get a better understanding of how to utilise it in order to achieve our desired project. For this we split into 2 groups of 3 as more numbers would lead to diminishing returns in learning.

For my group, I was working with Nella and Louis to practice lighting up an LED. Our goal was to simply understand circuitry and the Arduino IDE.

Afterwards, we worked on the buzzerchaser [(See here)](/experiments/led-buzzerchaser). 
The goal for this was to understand the normal flow of input and output.
