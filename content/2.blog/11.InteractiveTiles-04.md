This week we finished up some of the board decorations. More importantly, however, is that we finished the wiring for the button matrix which allowed us to finally test the whole matrix<->led interactions.

There were a lot of issues found, however, one button kept lighting up random tiles in the board. We remapped the tiles, but there were still issues with some buttons failing to light up their respective tile. This unfortunately meant a large possibility of the button wiring having flaws, but there was a chance that it was the code that was causing an issue. Several attempts at fixing it from the coding side was met in failure.
