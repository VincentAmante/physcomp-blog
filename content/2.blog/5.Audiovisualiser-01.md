title: Audiovisualiser Week 01
---

For this week, we assigned key roles for the project, here are my group mates and our assigned work:
- **Electronics**: Anthony, Nella, Franchesca, Princelle
- **Coding**: Vincent, Franchesca, (Later joined by Anthony)
- **Assembly Work**: Nella, Nehan, Princelle

By this point in time, we have already gotten our LED strip, so we began experimenting with it to create test displays. On my end we also began attempts at desoldering LED strips and soldering it to a board so we can estimate the physical workflow required when working on our project.

On my side, we were looking at reverse engineering the code from previous samples to see how we would combine together to achieve the result we desired. We found that tweaking it would not be hard, but the code samples for the LED display were somewhat incomplete and required a fair bit more work on.
