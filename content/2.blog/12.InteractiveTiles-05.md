This week I began a test to see if the problem with the button matrix was the code and not the wiring. I re-did one of our [earlier experiments ](/blog/interactivetiles-02) trying out a button matrix, and found that the problem was not with the code at all. Unfortunately, it meant the assembly team had to do the work again.

## Rewiring

Thankfully, they came up with an alternative method. By using hot glue to ensure the fragile jumper wires we were working with held together, it allowed us to achieve insulated wires that would not break easily. 

This was a lot faster than previous attempts, and allowed us to condense a month's work of soldering into less than a week of hot-gluing.
