The week came at last where we finished our project. 
We brought the interactive board to campus, 
where plenty of students and professors approached to play around with it.

Given that it was the entire purpose of our project (other than grades), 
we demonstrated the project with them as users. This also allowed us to find last-minute bugs which we fixed on the day itself. 

Overall reception from students and professors alike was brilliant, and the project itself appears to hold sturdy.

We made the demo video this week, where we showcased all of the project's features. Overall a fun week and a relieving sense of relief for this module.
