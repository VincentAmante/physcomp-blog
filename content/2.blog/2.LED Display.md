title: Outlining LED Display
---

Later on though, we kind of realised the issues that would present when it comes to having a water display (protecting against water damage, cleanliness, etc.). We pivoted to an LED display instead, where we simply threw several ideas to see what could work on that concept.

Eventually we settled on the following:
1. Audio visualiser
2. Games
3. Pixel Art tool

We decided that these were both interesting enough for us while at the level of difficulty that was not too hard to achieve. So we began researching prior projects and estimating the material requirements for the LED display.
