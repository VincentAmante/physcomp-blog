This week we managed to fix up the LED strip issue, which was definitely caused by broken connections.

We began tests by setting up the audiovisualiser code. Thankfully this one did not require much set up because most of the code was already in place from prior examples we've found. There were a few issues likely related to the fact that it was not built for the LED board dimensions we've had, but by the end of the week it was fully working.
