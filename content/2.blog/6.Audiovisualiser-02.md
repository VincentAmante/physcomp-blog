title: Audiovisualiser Week 02 
---

For this week, we've gotten new equipment for soldering the LED strips. The members working on soldering the LEDs together were continuing the work managed to finish, except there was a problem where data did not seem to properly transmit throughout the LEDs. 

Outside of that we were still waiting for delivery of our other parts: the buttons, the foam, other wires, among other parts.
