The beginning of all projects is the idea stage. We wanted to work on something that would have the potential to last long and remain an installation in the Campus.

We began throwing around ideas, many of them ranged in difficulty, practicality, and maintainability. One of the ideas I suggested was an 'attendance-checker', which when thought through was nothing more than one of those machines that track attendance when you tap a card on it.

A lot of other ideas were thrown around, such as LED Tetris, Smart Garbage Bins (Too difficult and too similar to a previous concept), a mirror that features student information amongst other details (too expensive and too code heavy).

Eventually, for this week we settled on an Interactive Water Display.
