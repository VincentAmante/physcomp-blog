# SOS Led


SOS Led is one of our earliest experiments, practically a 'hello world' for Arduino. The goal of the experiment was to write the simplest message in morsecode, 'SOS'.

This is a highly basic experiment as it only requires an arduino board, an led light, and a power supply.

## Parts
- Arduino Board
- LED light
- Connection Cable (+ device for IDE and Power)
