SOS Led is one of our earliest experiments, practically a 'hello world' for Arduino. The goal of the experiment was to write the simplest message in morsecode, 'SOS'.

This is a highly basic experiment as it only requires an arduino board, an led light, and a power supply.

## Parts
- Arduino Board
- LED light
- Connection Cable (+ device for IDE and Power)

## Instructions
- Attach an LED to pin 13 and GND (these sockets on an Arduino UNO are practically next to each-other)
- Use code below:
```c
// the setup function runs once when you press reset
// or power the board
void setup() {
    // initialize digital pin 11 as an output.
    pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}


void S(){
  for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
    delay(250);
    digitalWrite(13, LOW);
    delay(500);
  }
}
 
void O(){
  for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
    delay(500);
    digitalWrite(13, LOW);
    delay(500);
  }
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  S();
  delay(500);
  O();
  delay(500);
  S();
  delay(1000);
}
```

- Connect device with code to Arduino (powering it)
- Upload code to Arduino
