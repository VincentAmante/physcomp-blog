## Instructions

### References: 
- [Interactive LED Tile Wall Instructable by ChrisParkerTech](https://www.instructables.com/Interactive-LED-Tile-Wall-Easier-Than-It-Looks/)
- [Interactive FFT Visualiser Instructable by ChrisParketTech](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-FFT-Visualizer-With-Addressable-LEDs/)

We took inspiration from these two instructables, having taken the general direction of their works and using it as a baseline for our own.

### Code
> Throughout these instructions, some code snippets are mentioned, this is mostly for a better understanding of why the set up is done the way it is.
> In addition, it would also be used for explaining the code section later down the page.

### Making the LED display
- The LED display is one whole strip that you have to cut evenly.
- The strips have several metal connections each for ground, power, and digital input
- Cutting the strips at these connections will allow you to solder them together without issue.
- Arrange the strips in alternating directions, spaced out evenly and directly parallel to each other.
- Connect the strips via soldering, ensure that electricity can flow through the wiring without issue.

### Button Matrix
- The button matrix is a grid that utilises a row and column of a given button to detemine its position
	- See: [Interactive Tiles Week 01's Blog Post](/blog/interactivetiles-01#button-matrix) for more information on this concept
 - Create the grid
	 - Each row will connect to an individual pin and connects to one leg of every button in the row
	 - Each column will connect to an individual pin and connects to the diagonally opposing leg of every button in the column
	 - Ensure all buttons are of the same orientation, the button has 2 parallel sides where each leg on that side is connected to one another
		 - Pressing the button is what connects the row and column together
		 - With all this in mind, make sure that the row and column connections do not overlap irrespective of the button's state
	- The wiring will be soldered or hot-glued, depending on the strength of your wires and availability of time or resources (preferring soldering for quality)
- Place the button matrix on top of the LED display, ensure that each button is matched to where its tile is meant to be (a tile consists of 2x3 leds)
- Setting it up
	- The code block below sets up the led display to be used
```c
#define LED_PIN     6     // Data pin to LEDS
#define NUM_LEDS    270  // Set according to how many LEDS are in your strip
#define BRIGHTNESS  255    // from 0 to 255
#define LED_TYPE    WS2812B
#define COLOR_ORDER GRB

int values[ROWS][COLS]; // 2D array to keep track of the current color of each tile
int mem_values[ROWS][COLS]; // 2D array to keep track Memory Colors
int brightness[ROWS][COLS]; // 2D array to keep track of the current brightness of each tile
// LED array
CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];
CRGBPalette16 currentPalette;

void setup(){

// .. other code
	FastLED.addLeds<LED_TYPE, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection( TypicalLEDStrip );
	
	FastLED.setBrightness(  BRIGHTNESS );
}
// ..
```


#### Coding it in
- Keep track of which rows and columns are connected to which pins.
- Make the button matrix using the grid below:

```c
// no of tile rows and cols
const byte rows = 5;
const byte cols = 9;

// Used for calculating button position within the tilegrid
// Follow this pattern where button (row1, col1) = 1, (row2, col2) = 12
char keys[rows][cols] = {
  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 },
  {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 },
  {21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29},
  {31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 },
  {41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49 },
};

// pins of the rows and columns
// 30 = First Row
// 31 = First Column
byte rowPins[rows] = {30, 28, 26, 24, 22 };
byte colPins[cols] = {31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47 };
```

- When you want to light up a tile, a code similar to the one below is used:
```c

int location = buttons.getKey();

// using the keys[][] array values,
// a tile is lit up by rounding down its value to find the matching row and column
light_tile(location/10, (location%10)-1, color, 255); //Light tile color
values[location/10][(location%10)-1] = color;
```


### Mode button
The mode button is a simple button attached to the Arduino, setting it up is no different from other experiments and uses similar concepts

### Tiles
The tiles are placed using square acrylic sheets  on top of the buttons, and kept cushioned by some foam on the sides. This allows for a wider accessibility to the button. 
They can be done through any means, however, so long as you can press the button and see the light beneath it.


### Mic 
Mic does not need any special instruction, just attach its corresponding pins to the arduino and set up using the code below:
```c
// Visualiser
#define MIC_IN A15
void setup(){
	//.. other code
    pinMode(MIC_IN, INPUT);
	//..
}
```

For using it with the visualiser though, you'll need to include the following code for setup
```c
// Number of LED rows and columns
// Visualiser is more precise than the tiles
#define SAMPLES 32       // Must be a power of 2
#define xres 18
#define yres 15

double vReal[SAMPLES];
double vImag[SAMPLES];

int Intensity[xres] = { };
int Displacement = 1;
arduinoFFT FFT = arduinoFFT();
```

### Frame
The rest of the project is completely up to you as it is mostly framing. Any container works for the Interactive Display so long as it can support the Arduini Board and does not interfere with the wiring itself.

## Code
For the full repo, [Click here to see the code in its entirety](https://github.com/louisuy/deenoboard/blob/main/deenoboard.ino)

The code for DeenoBoard is an amalgmation of features that align to form our intended experience. This section breaks down a few of the code to help those reading the file above to better understand how it functions

### Lighting up an LED
All leds are stored in an array called `leds[]`{lang="c"}, lighting up any specific led simply assigns a value to it, and displayed via `FastLED.show()`{lang="c"}
```c
 leds[led]= CHSV(color, sat, brightness);
  
```

Complications come in when lighting an led by row/column, lighting up a tile, row, column, etc. All of which are calculated in respect to the dimensions of the board

#### Lighting up an LED by position, column, and row
An LED's position given a row and column is calculated by utilising the length of each strip and whether the strip is an odd or even column. (See [this blog](/blogs/interactivetiles-02) for more information) 
```c
// lights a specific led dictated by row and column
void light_led(int row, int col, int color, int brightness, int sat = 255){
  int extra = 0;
  // extra is used to calculate the position of an LED on even columns
  if (col % 2 != 0){
    col -= 1;
    extra = 1 + (row * 2);
  }

  int led = (14 - row) + (15 * col) + extra;
  leds[led]= CHSV(color, sat, brightness);
  FastLED.show();    
}
```

This was used to light up the rows, on which unlike lighting up by column, the leds are not adjacent to eachother on the strip
```c
void light_row(int colStart, int colEnd, int row, int color, int bright){
  for (int i = colStart; i <= colEnd; i++){
    light_led(row, i, color, bright);
  }
}

//.. lighting up columns for reference
void light_column(int rowStart, int rowEnd, int col, int color, int bright){
    for(int i=rowStart; i >= rowEnd; i--){
        leds[i + 15*col]= CHSV(color, 255, bright);
    }
}
```

Lighting up a tile uses similar calculations, and also stores the value of the led in `values[][]`{lang="c"} and `brightness[][]`{lang="c"} respectively.
```c
void light_tile(int row, int col, int color, int bright, int sat = 255){
    if (color == 256)
        bright = 0;

    for(int i=14; i >= 12; i--){
        leds[i - 3*row + 30*col]= CHSV(color, sat, bright);
    }

    for(int i=15; i <= 17; i++){
        leds[i + 3*row + 30*col]= CHSV(color, sat, bright);
    }
    
    // values array keeps track of the current colour of a tile
    values[row][col] = color;
    brightness[row][col] = bright;
}
```



## Mode Switching
Switching between modes uses a button unrelated to the matrix. Switching mode simply checks to see if the button has been pressed, this function is placed strategically in each mode so that the user can switch out almost anytime.

```c
bool isModeBtnPressed(){
  currentState = digitalRead(MODE_PIN);
  
  if (lastState == LOW && currentState == HIGH){
  // Adds delay for tic tac toe to prevent a bug where it switches too fast
    if (mode == 2){
      delay(500);
    }
    
    cycle_mode();
    Serial.println('Mode switching');
    lastState = currentState;
    return true;
  }
  
  lastState = currentState;
  return false;
}
```

Switching a mode is a simple increment with a reset, of which the mode is checked for within loop
```c
void cycle_mode(){
  Serial.println('cycling');
  mode++;
  if (mode > NUM_MODES){
    mode = 1;
  }
}

  

void loop() {
  isModeBtnPressed();
  switch(mode){
    case 1:
      Visualiser();
      break;
      
    case 2:
      light_screen(16, 255, 255, 1000);
      paint();
      FastLED.show();
      clear_display();
      break;
      
    case 3:
      light_screen(96, 255, 255, 1000);
      tic();
      clear_display();
      break;
      
    case 4:
      light_screen(180, 255, 255, 1000);
      Memory();
      clear_display();
      delay(2500);        // Wait 2.5 secs before showing next set of tiles
      break;
  }
}
```


## AudioVisualiser
The exact mechanisms of how the audio-visualiser works is unknowst to us, it uses the ArduinoFFT library which only requires you to provide the mic and some starter details (provided above). as well as the LED strip. It then handles the heavy work on its own given that both the led and the mic is fully functional.

## Paint
Paint is one of the game modes in our project. It is simple in concept, utilising the `values[]`{lang="c"} array and a `color`{lang="c"} variable to store colours.

Like all of the game modes, paint runs on a loop that exits when certain buttons are pressed, such as the mode switch button or holding a specific tile. 
The colour itself is set based on the tile being pressed, on an empty tile it applies the saved colour, which starts out as red. Pressing a coloured tile cycles the color forward, which is then saved and applied on any new tile. On a completed cycle the tile resets to having no colour.
```c
void paint(){
  clear_display();
  bool tap = 1;
  int color = 0;
  while(tap){                                               //Loop until a button is held
    int location = buttons.getKey();
    if (location){                                          //if a button is pressed
    
      if(values[location/10][(location%10)-1] != 256){
        color = values[location/10][(location%10)-1] + 32;  //Update Color if tile is already colored
        
        if (color > 256)
          color = 0;
      }  
      else if (color == 256)                                //Loop back to red at end of rainbow
        color = 0;

      light_tile(location/10, (location%10)-1, color, 255); //Light tile color
      values[location/10][(location%10)-1] = color;
      FastLED.show();                                       //Update display
      delay(100);                                           //wait 1/10th of a second
    }

    if (isModeBtnPressed()){
      tap = 0;
    }
    if(buttons.getState() == HOLD)                          //Exit function if tile held
      tap = 0;
  }
}
```

## Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe runs on the same loop format that Paint does, except it has a turn feature. The game has  a 3x3 grid, on which players are only allowed to colour a tile on this play area. The colour playing is determined with turns, on which a successful press flips the turn over.

The code for determining valid tiles checks to see if the tile is within the play-area, and then checks if the tile has already been pressed during the round.
```c
      for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++){
        for (int j = 3; j < 6; j++){
          if ((location / 10) == i && ((location % 10) - 1) == j){
            isValidBtn = true;
          }

          if (values[i][j] == values[(location / 10)][((location % 10) - 1)]){
            if (values[i][j] == 0 || values[i][j] == 120){
              isAlreadyPushed = true;
            }
          }
        }
      }
      if (!isAlreadyPushed && isValidBtn){
        int color = 0;
        if(turn)
          color = 120;
        light_tile(location/10, (location%10)-1, color, 255);
        delay(100);
        FastLED.show();
        turn = !turn;
      }
```


The game checks for a winner after every successful press, checking every row, column, and 3-tile diagonal for any set of matching colours. The colour on a found pattern then determines the winner, which resets the game.

```c
//// ! For loops which check for horziontal and vertical matching lines
  // Checks for tiles lit up in a row
  for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++){
    if (values[i][3] == values[i][4] && values[i][3] == values[i][5]){
      if (values[i][3] == 0){
        redwins();
        return 0;
      }
      if (values[i][3] == 120){
        bluewins();
        return 0;
      }
    }
  }

  // Checks for tiles lit up in a column
  for (int i = 3; i < 6; i++){
    if (values[1][i] == values[2][i] && values[1][i] == values[3][i]){
      if (values[1][i] == 0){
        redwins();
        return 0;
      }
      if (values[1][i] == 120){
        bluewins();
        return 0;
      }
    }
  }
```


## Memory
A combination of all the LED and tile knowledge utilised till now, Memory is a game that challenges the player's ability to memorise pairs on a board. You are briefly flashed a grid of color pairs, and then presented with an empty play-area. Pressing any two tiles reveal their colours, which on a match stays lit and otherwise goes dark. The goal is to get the entire board lit up.

Like in Tic Tac Toe, it checks for a press in the valid play area. It also uses 2d arrays to store colour values like in Paint, which is used to determine matching colours. 

The Memory Game initialises by a for loop that runs 9 times, where it then looks for a random uncoloured tile where it assigns it a new colour. After being able to assign a colour twice, it determines the pair complete and moves on to do the same thing until the entire grid is filled.

```c
  for(int j = 0; j < 9; j++){         //Place 9 colors
    for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++){        //place each color twice
      bool tile_not_empty = 1;
      while(tile_not_empty){        //don't place color over another color
        int row = (random(1, 4));       //Get random tile
        int col = (random(2, 8));
        if(mem_values[row][col] == 256){  //Check if tile is empty
          mem_values[row][col] = colors[j];   //Place color
          light_tile(row, col, colors[j], values[j]);
          FastLED.show();
          tile_not_empty = 0;         //Exit loop
        }
      }
    }
    continue;
  }
```
